# DS-U4-S2-Neural-Networks

Sometimes a squiggly is not just a squiggly, and requires some very fancy technology to interpret. In these notebooks we go through the full process of setting up a Tensorflow-keras neural network from scratch and train it to perform optical character recognition. The quickdraw image and character sets are used for most of the training and validation, but later the theoretical capacity is pushed to more interesting levels.
